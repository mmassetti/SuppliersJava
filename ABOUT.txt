1) From "SuperProveedores.jar" you can execute the application

2) Three external libraries are used:
- commnos-lang3-3.5.jar : To check input values from the user
- jdom-2.0.6.jar: To work with XML files
- jcalendar-1.4 : To work with the calendar 

In Eclipse (if used) these libraries have to be added, going to Build Path -> Add External Jar.

3) If Eclipse is used, the main method is in the class VentanAcceso.java. From there you can execute the app.

4) I decided to work with XML files for the storage.
